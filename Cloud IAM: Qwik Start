2. Click Activate Cloud Shell the icon that activates cloud shell to open the Cloud Shell command line. If prompted click Continue.

3. Open up a Cloud Shell session and then enter in the following command, replace [YOUR_BUCKET_NAME] with the name of the bucket you created earlier:

Copied!
You should receive a similar output:

Note: If you see AccessDeniedException, wait a minute and run the previous command again.
As you can see, you gave Username 2 view access to the Cloud Storage bucket.
